        <p>OUTLINEThisis the ninthin a series of regular situation
            reports on the Ebola Response Roadmap1. The report contains
            areviewoftheepidemiologicalsituationbasedonofficialinformationreportedby ministriesofhealth,andan</p>
        <p>assessment of the response measured against the core Roadmap
            indicators where available. The data contained inthis report
            are the best available. Because of widespread
            under-reporting of confirmed cases in Liberia,
            suspectedcases are now also shownin country histograms.
            Substantial efforts are ongoing toimprove the availability
            andaccuracy of information about both the epidemiological
            situation and the implementation of response measures.</p>
        <p>Following the roadmap structure, country reports fall into
            three categories: (1) those with widespread and
            intensetransmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); (2)
            those with or that have had an initial case or cases, or
            withlocalizedtransmission(Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, andthe
            United States of America); and(3),those
            countriesthatneighbourorhavestrongtradetieswithareasofactivetransmission.AnoverviewofthesituationintheDemocratic
            Republic ofthe Congo, wherethereis aseparate, unrelated

        <p>1. COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSIONA total
            of 9911 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and
            4868 deaths have been reported up to the</p>
        <p>end of 19 October 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea,
            and Sierra Leone, and 18 October for Liberia (table1). All
            but one district in Liberia and all Sierra Leone have now
            reported at least one case of EVD since the start ofthe
            outbreak (figure 4). Of the eight Guinean and Liberian
            districts that share a border with C te d Ivoire, only
            theGuinean district of Mandiana is yet to report a confirmed
            or probable case of EVD.</p>

        <p>GUINEAEVD transmission in Guinea remains intense. By contrast
            with Liberia and Sierra Leone, however, several areas of</p>
        <p>Guinea are still to report a single case of EVD, whilst seven
            have now been free of cases for over 21 days after aninitial
            case or cases of EVD (figure 4).</p>
        <p>The outbreak in Guinea is being driven by transmission in
            four key areas. The 18 confirmed cases newly reportedthis
            weekfromthecapital,Conakry,isthesecondhighest
            weeklytotalsincetheoutbreakbegan(figure1).N
            Zerekore(19confirmedcases)anderouane(18confirmedcases)haveshownasustainedincreaseinnewcases
            over the past two weeks. Both areas are near the border with
            C te d Ivoire to the east; tothe west theyborder the
            district of Macenta, where transmission has
            beenintenseforthe past 10 weeks(38 new confirmedcases
            reported during the past week).</p>
        <p>The district of Coyah reported 5 new confirmed cases this
            week compared with 25 the previous week, but it is tooearly
            to tell whether this decline will be sustained. Gueckedou,
            where the outbreak originated, has reported fewnew cases for
            the past 6 weeks (2 confirmed cases this week), but
            transmission is persistent.</p>
        <p>Two districts in Guinea reported a case or cases of EVD for
            the first time during the past week. In the east of
            thecountry, on the border with C te d Ivoire and on a ma or
            trade route with Mali, the previously unaffected districtof
            Kankan reported 1 new confirmed case(figure 4), again
            emphasizing the needfor active surveillance

            previously unaffected district of Faranah has reported 1
            newconfirmed cases. Faranah is bordered by the newly
            affected Sierra Leonean district of Koinadugu to the
            southwest.The adjacent central district of Mamou, which was
            classified last week as having reported its first confirmed
            case,is now classed as unaffected after the single confirmed
            case was discarded.</p>
        <p/>
        <p>Data are based on official information reported by the
            Ministry of Health of Guinea up to the end of 19 October.
            These numbers are subjectto change due to ongoing
            reclassification, retrospective investigation and
            availability of laboratory results.</p>
        <p>LIBERIAThe 444 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases
            reported from Liberia this week is the highest numberin the</p>

        <p/>
        <p>Only 15 of the 444 new casesreported nationwidefrom Liberia
            this week are confirmed cases. Thisis due to acontinuing
            failure to integrate laboratory results into clinical
            epidemiology reports. Many probable and suspectedcases are
            likely to be genuine cases of EVD.</p>
        <p>Outside Monrovia, most newly reported cases have come from
            the districts of Bong (40 cases), Margibi (22 cases),and
            Nimba (29 cases), which borders both C te d Ivoire to the
            east and Guinea to the north. The recent fall in thenumber
            of new cases reported from Lofa, which borders the district
            of Gueckedou in Guinea, has continued for athird week (two
            confirmed cases). Reports from observers suggest this is a
            genuine decline as a result of controlmeasures.</p>

        <p>HEALTH-CARE WORKERSA total of 443 health-care workers (HCWs)
            are known to have been infected with EVD up to the end of 19 October.</p>
        <p>244 HCWs have died (table 2). WHO is undertaking extensive
            investigations to determine the cause of infection ineach
            case. Early indications are that a substantial proportion of
            infections occurred outside the context of Ebolatreatment
            and care. Infection prevention and control quality assurance
            checks are now underway at every Ebolatreatment unitin
            thethreeintense-transmission countries. At the same time,
            exhaustive efforts are ongoing toensure an ample supply of
            optimal personal protective equipment to all Ebola treatment
            facilities, along with theprovision of training and relevant
            guidelines to ensure that all HCWs are exposed to the

            services, preserve stability, and prevent the spread of

        <p>Following the creation of UNMEER, a comprehensive 90-day plan
            to control and reverse the epidemic of EVD inWest Africa has
            been put into action. To rapidly reverse the current crisis,
            capacity will be put in place to isolate atleast 70% of EVD
            cases and safely bury at least 70% of patients who die from
            EVD by 1 December 2014 (the 60-daytarget). The ultimate
            goalisto have capacityin placefortheisolation of 100% of EVD
            cases andthesafeburial of 100% of patients who die from EVD
            by 1 January 2015 (the 90-day target), which is projected to
            result
            inadecliningrateoftransmission.InaccordancewiththeWHOEbolaResponseRoadmap,the90-dayEbolaResponse
            plan requires that at least 50% of major inputs in five
            crucial domains be put in place by 1 November,with 100% of
            inputs in place by 1 December. Progress towards putting
            these inputs in place and the attainment ofeach target will
            be assessed through a comprehensive response-monitoring
            system, and will be reported in duecourse. The latest key
            developments in each domain are detailed below.</p>
        <p>Case managementCapacityfor case management has
            beenincreasedsubstantiallyin allthreeintense-transmission
            countries, butremainsfarshortofrequirements(figure5).Recent
            operationalplanningpro ectionsholdthat4388bedsarerequiredin
            50 Ebola treatment units(ETUs) across the
            threeintense-transmission countries(table 3) to achievethe
            target of isolating 70% of EVD cases by 1 December. At
            present, 1126 (25%) are alreadyin place. In addition,there
            remains a gapin the availability offoreign medical teams to
            manage and staff ETUs. At present, there arefirm commitments
            from teams for 30 of the 50 ETUs. WHO continues to work with
            Member States and partners toclose these gaps.</p>
        <p>A lack of available beds in ETUs often forces families to
            care for sick relatives at home. In the home setting,
            caregivers are unable to adequately protect themselves from
            EVD exposure, and thus the risk of transmission
            withinthefamily andthroughoutthecommunityisgreatlyincreased.
            Asaremedial measure, Ebola Community CareUnits
            (ECUs)/Community Care Centres (CCCs) are now being trialled
            by governments and partners in both
            SierraLeoneandLiberia.Thesefacilitieswillbecloselylinkedtootheressentialactivitiessuchascasefinding,community

            A formal WHO Guidelines Development Group, which includes

        <p>Case confirmationBased on the most recent operational
            planning projections, an estimated 28 laboratories are
            required across the</p>
        <p>three intense-transmission countries. At present, 12
            laboratories are operational (three in Guinea, five in
            Liberia,and four in Sierra Leone; figure 5). In Sierra
            Leone, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention
            laboratorythat was previously located in Kenema has now
            relocated to the district of Bo.</p>

        <p>Social mobilizationSocial mobilization,including

            focused on the need to isolate suspected cases early,
            promote safeand dignified burials for those who die, and
            address misperceptions, resistance, and stigma associated
            with EVD.</p>

            Spain will therefore be declared free of EVD 42 days after
            the date of the second negative test if no newcases are
            reported. A total of 83 contacts are being monitored.</p>

        <p>preparedness in countries at high risk of an outbreak of EVD.
            Important factors in preventing the spread of EVD
            inbothcountriesincludedstrong politicalleadership, early
            detection andresponse, public awareness campaigns,and strong
            support from partner organizations.</p>
        <p>In accordance with the UNMEER 90-day plan, strengthening the
            ability of all countries to respond effectively to aninitial
            case of EVD is a mission-critical priority. Accordingly, all
            countries should have a protocol for suspect cases,an
            equipped isolation unit, a minimum stock of personal
            protective equipment, a case-management team trainedin
            infection prevention and control, and a public
            communications strategy.</p>

            A meeting between WHO and partner organizations in
            Brazzaville on 10 October agreed on a range oftools to
            support countries unaffected by Ebola in strengthening their
            preparednessin the event of an outbreak.One of these tools
            is a comprehensive consolidated checklist of 10 core
            components and tasks for countries andthe international community.</p>
        <p>Thechecklistdefines

        <p>Beginning with missions to Cote D Ivoire and Mali, WHO teams
            will build on previous work with each country tohelp
            identify any gaps in their capacity to identify and respond
            to an initial EVD case. The programme of work willinclude a
            simulation exercise to test the performance of detection and
            response systems to a suspected case ofEVD.</p>
        <p>On 22 October 2014, WHOconvenedthethird Emergency Committee
            on Ebola undertheInternational HealthRegulations(2005). The
            Committee will review thelatest developmentsin the epidemic
            and advise on whetheradjustments should be made to current
            recommendations on how to halt the spread of EVD.</p>
