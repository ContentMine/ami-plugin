  <p/>In Mali, there have been 4 reported cases, including 3 reported deaths. The Situation Report of 12 November reported 4 cases (2 confirmed and 2 probable) and 4 deaths in Mali. One probable case and death has been reclassified and is now excluded from the Mali case count. 
  <p/>Situation reports are now presented in a web-based format to provide detailed information at the country level, including data and maps, in a more interactive way.

  <b>1. COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION</b> A total of 14 383 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 5165 deaths have been reported up to the end of the 11 November by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 10 November by the Ministry of Health of Liberia (table 1).

  </div>A total of 570 health-care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD: 93 in Guinea; 332 in Liberia; 2 in Mali; 11 in Nigeria; 128 in Sierra Leone; 1 in Spain; and 3 in the United States of America (2 were infected in the USA and 1 in Guinea). A total of 324 HCWs have died. 
  <p/>WHO is undertaking extensive investigations to determine how each HCW became infected. Early indications are that a substantial proportion of infections have occurred outside the context of Ebola treatment and care. Infection prevention and control quality assurance checks are underway at Ebola treatment centres in the three intense-transmission countries. At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk.

  <b>ANNEX 1: CATEGORIES USED TO CLASSIFY EBOLA CASES</b> Ebola cases are classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed depending on whether they meet certain criteria (table 3).

  <b>ANNEX 2: EBOLA OUTBREAK IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</b> There have been 66 cases (38 confirmed, 28 probable) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 8 among health-care workers (HCWs). In total, 49 deaths have been reported, including 8 among HCWs. All contacts have completed the 21-day follow-up period. 
  <p/>As of 11 November, 33 days have passed since the last case tested negative for the second time and was discharged from hospital. The Democratic Republic of the Congo will therefore be declared free of EVD 42 days after the date of the second negative test if no new cases are reported. This outbreak is unrelated to the outbreak that originated in West Africa.
