SUMMARY 
A total of 14 413 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in six 
affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States of America) and two 
previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal) up to the end of 11 November 2014. There have been 5177 
reported deaths.  
 
Following the WHO Ebola Response Roadmap structure1, country reports fall into two categories: 1) those with 
widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); and 2) those with or that have had an 
initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the United States of 
America). An overview of a separate, unrelated outbreak of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also 
provided (see Annex 2). 
 
In Mali, there have been 4 reported cases, including 3 reported deaths. The Situation Report of 12 November 
reported 4 cases (2 confirmed and 2 probable) and 4 deaths in Mali. One probable case and death has been 
reclassified and is now excluded from the Mali case count. 
 
Situation reports are now presented in a web-based format to provide detailed information at the country level, 
including data and maps, in a more interactive way. 
 
1. COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION 
A total of 14 383 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 5165 deaths have been reported up to the 
end of the 11 November by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 10 November by the Ministry 
of Health of Liberia (table 1).

Data are based on official information reported by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone up to the end of 11 November, and 
the Ministry of Health of Liberia up to the end of 10 November. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, 
retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results. *N/A. **Liberia has fewer deaths than the last situation report due to 
reclassification.  
 
A total of 570 health-care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD: 93 in Guinea; 332 in Liberia; 
2 in Mali; 11 in Nigeria; 128 in Sierra Leone; 1 in Spain; and 3 in the United States of America (2 were infected in 
the USA and 1 in Guinea). A total of 324 HCWs have died. 
 
WHO is undertaking extensive investigations to determine how each HCW became infected. Early indications are 
that a substantial proportion of infections have occurred outside the context of Ebola treatment and care. 
Infection prevention and control quality assurance checks are underway at Ebola treatment centres in the three 
intense-transmission countries. At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of 
optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training 
and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk.  
2. COUNTRIES WITH AN INITIAL CASE OR CASES, OR WITH LOCALIZED TRANSMISSION 
Five countries (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the United States of America) have reported a case or cases 
imported from a country with widespread and intense transmission (table 2).  
 
In Mali, there have been 4 reported cases, including 3 reported deaths, as of 13 November. The most recently 
reported cases in Bamako are not related to the first case in Kayes, who died on 24 October. A total of 251 
contacts are being followed-up in Bamako, and 5 in Kourémalé. Twelve contacts related to the first case are still 
under follow-up in Kayes.  
 
There have been 4 cases and 1 death in the United States of America. All patients have been discharged from 
hospital, and all contacts in the country have completed the 21-day follow-up period.  
 
In Spain, 24 days have passed since the HCW infected while caring for an Ebola patient in Madrid tested negative 
twice and was discharged from hospital. Spain will therefore be declared free of EVD 42 days after the date of the 
second negative test if no new cases are reported. All 83 contacts of the HCW have completed 21-day follow-up.

EBOLA RESPONSE ROADMAP SITUATION REPORT 
 
In Nigeria, there were 20 cases and 8 deaths. In Senegal, there was 1 case and no deaths. However, following a 
successful response in both countries, the outbreaks of EVD in Senegal and Nigeria were declared over on 17 
October and 19 October 2014, respectively.

Data for cases in the past 21 days for Liberia do not include confirmed cases from 26 October, due to data unavailability. Data are based 
on situation reports provided by countries. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply the

*Includes two HCWs infected in the USA while treating an EVD-positive patient from Liberia, and a HCW infected in Guinea. Data are based

investigation and availability of laboratory results.  
 
ANNEX 1: CATEGORIES USED TO CLASSIFY EBOLA CASES 
Ebola cases are classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed depending on whether they meet certain criteria 
(table 3). 
Table 3: Ebola case-classification criteria 
Classification Criteria 
Any person, alive or dead, who has (or had) sudden onset of high fever and had contact with a 
suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola case, or a dead or sick animal OR any person with sudden 
Suspected onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: headache, vomiting, anorexia/ loss of 
appetite, diarrhoea, lethargy, stomach pain, aching muscles or joints, difficulty swallowing, breathing 
difficulties, or hiccup; or any person with unexplained bleeding OR any sudden, unexplained death. 
Any suspected case evaluated by a clinician OR any person who died from ‘suspected’ Ebola and had 
Probable an epidemiological link to a confirmed case but was not tested and did not have laboratory 
confirmation of the disease. 
Confirmed A probable or suspected case is classified as confirmed when a sample from that person tests positive 
for Ebola virus in the laboratory. 
 
ANNEX 2: EBOLA OUTBREAK IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 
There have been 66 cases (38 confirmed, 28 probable) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, including 8 among health-care workers (HCWs). In total, 49 deaths have been reported, 
including 8 among HCWs. All contacts have completed the 21-day follow-up period.  
 
As of 11 November, 33 days have passed since the last case tested negative for the second time and was 
discharged from hospital. The Democratic Republic of the Congo will therefore be declared free of EVD 42 days 
after the date of the second negative test if no new cases are reported. This outbreak is unrelated to the outbreak 
that originated in West Africa.
